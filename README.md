# BloodMagicWiki
A wiki for Blood Magic

# For Developers
Will eventually clean it up, but should be usuable if you copy the repository. Just run gradlew setupDevWorkspace from the folder.

# For Contributors
IGW is designed to be highly usuable for people with no coding experience, although it really helps. Only Hellfire Forge recipes are integrated, but soon others will be as well. You can design and setup pages, but the will be edited before comitted to a released version. More to be added as people actually want to contribute. :P
