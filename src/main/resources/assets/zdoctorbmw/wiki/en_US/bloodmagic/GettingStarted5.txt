Sigils are powerful artifacts used by Blood Mages with a varirty of functions, and new Sigils are constantly being developed by Blood Mages. 

Though similar, Binding is the process of transforming an item to a more powerful version. This item can then be connected to your Soul Network through interaction. Once connected, they will draw from their owners Soul Network in place of damage to the item. Bound Tools can be charge to perform a more powerful version of their intended use, check in [link{zdoctorbmw:bloodmagic/BoundEquipment}] Bound Equipment[link{}] for a listing of recipes.

There are two parts to Sigil Creation and Binding: the Reagent and the Catalyst. Reagents can range from regular Items to exotic material, with the latter be the more common. The Catalyst needs to be either a Slate or a peice of equipment, respectively.

The most rudimentary of Slates is known as the Blank Slate. It is the building block of any Sigil and subsequent creations, such as runes.

Once created, it can be used to create one of the most useful tools for a Blood Mage known as a Divination Sigil.

To prepare the Ashes, place it on a flat surface. When this is ready, place the reagent, followed by the Catalyst, and stand back as it finishes. The order in which these ingredients are placed is crucial. A wrong ingredient will ruin the circle and another batch of Arcane Ashes will need to be created.

With this in mind, you are now ready to Craft a Divination Sigil. Prepare a batch of Arcane Ashes and use these ingredients to create a Divination Sigil.
