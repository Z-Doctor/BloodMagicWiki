Blood Mages have categorized two types of rituals: Imperfect and Regular Rituals. Both have their own benefits, limitations, and distinctive operations.

Both types of rituals have an activation cost, however, Regular Rituals have a reoccurring cost for keeping it active. 

Both types of rituals also need certain blocks to dictate which ritual is to be performed and a Ritual Stone to determine the type of ritual being performed. The key difference here is that Imperfect Rituals require an Imperfect Ritual Stone and, typically, a regular block on top, while a Regular Ritual requires a Master Ritual Stone and a configuration of Rituals Stones placed around it with different symbols drawn onto each block.

Imperfect and Regular Rituals also have different activation methods, but both still require LP. The former can be activated by merely interacting with it, while the latter requires a tool, known as Activation Crystals. These crystals channel LP from their respective owners Soul Network to activate these rituals. It should be noted that only regular rituals are forgiving if a Blood Mage tries to perform them with insufficient LP.
