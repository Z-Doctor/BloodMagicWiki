Volume: I
Edition: I

Dedicated to the founder of the arts, WayofTime and his disciples of Blood Magic.

Before the Lost Period, Blood Mages would craft their tools by hand. These ways are lost to us now, but, through trial and error, Blood Mages have devised new ways to replicate the ways of old. This encyclopedia was created with the intention of preserving these new methods and documenting new discoveries. It is my hope that this book will help nurture the talents of young and aspiring Blood Mages.



Be warned, the arts are not for the weak of mind, of will, nor weak spirit.

You have been warned.
