Inversion Pillars

Try to spread, uses will in air, after spreading far enough can create a pillar.

No crafting recipes.

generate invesion using will or when there are nearby pillars

do not spawn natrually (yet).

3 parts. pill top, bottom and pillar

will rarely spawn blocks in air if it cannont replace anything else.

resets inversion when it creates a pillar

breakable same as stone

public static final double maxWillForChunk = 1000;

will create will in surronding chunks
