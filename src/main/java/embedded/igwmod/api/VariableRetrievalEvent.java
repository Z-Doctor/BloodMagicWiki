/**
 * This event is fired on MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS when a wikipage contains a [variable{<variableName>}] block, in which the <variableName is a string that is passed to this event.
 * This event can be used to retrieve values that you want to display on a wikipage that are dynamic, for example config options, or parameters that are prone to change.
 * You are responsible for a decent variable name. I'd suggest prefixing it with your modid to prevent collisions with other mods' variables.
 * If no subscriber has passed a return value for a variable name, it will be replaced by the variable name itself.
